<h1>🚴‍♂️ Project Title: Predicting Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon</h1>

<p>
  In this project, I used the <a href="https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html" target="_blank">AutoGluon</a> library to train models for the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand" target="_blank">Bike Sharing Demand</a> competition on Kaggle. By working with Tabular Prediction, I processed data from CSV files provided by the competition and fine-tuned several models to optimize their performance.
</p>

<h2>🛠️ Problem Solved:</h2>
<p>
  Predicting bike-sharing demand is crucial for effectively managing resources and improving user experience by anticipating service spikes. By accurately forecasting demand patterns, the project helps in better planning and resource allocation.
